                <p>
                    I'm Purity Gwaro, a passionate fullstack web developer with a deep love for creating 
                    meaningful digital experiences. My journey in tech began with curiosity and has evolved 
                    into a career focused on building scalable, user-friendly applications using modern 
                    JavaScript technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I specialize in React, Next.js, and Node.js, and I'm constantly exploring new tools and 
                    frameworks to enhance my skill set. Beyond coding, I believe in the power of continuous 
                    learning and sharing knowledge with the developer community. I am currently learning Elixir!

                <h2>Areas Where I Lack Confidence</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>System Design at Scale:</strong> While I understand basic architecture, 
                        designing systems that handle millions of users still feels challenging.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>DevOps and Infrastructure:</strong> Setting up CI/CD pipelines, managing 
                        cloud infrastructure, and containerization are areas I'm still building confidence in.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Advanced Algorithms:</strong> Complex data structures and algorithmic 
                        problem-solving sometimes intimidate me, especially under time pressure.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Public Speaking:</strong> Presenting technical concepts to large audiences 
                        or giving talks at conferences is something I'm working to overcome.

                        Dear Future Me,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Remember this moment: the excitement, the nervousness, and the determination you feel 
                        right now. You're embarking on this program with a clear vision: to grow, to learn, 
                        and to become the developer you've always aspired to be.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Don't be too hard on yourself when things get tough. Every bug you encounter, every 
                        concept that seems confusing at first, is just another step toward mastery. Celebrate 
                        the small wins, learn from the failures, and never lose sight of why you started.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Keep pushing boundaries, stay curious, and remember that growth happens outside your 
                        comfort zone. You've got this!
                    </p>

                <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
                <p>
                    Beyond the technical aspects, I believe that being a great developer is about more than 
                    just writing code. It's about putting yourself in users shoes, collaboration with teammates, and a 
                    commitment to building inclusive and accessible products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm excited about the future of web development from the rise of AI-assisted coding to 
                    the evolution of web standards. I want to be at the forefront of these changes, 
                    contributing to projects that make a positive impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This program represents a significant milestone in my journey, and I'm grateful for the 
                    opportunity to learn, grow, and connect with an amazing community of developers.
